# **CyberCraft - A primer for game-based learning in cyber security using Minecraft: Education Edition**

# Activity Overview
This activity is designed to enable and inspire educators, rather than to be delivered directly to students. It will introduce the capabilities of Minecraft: Education Edition as a tool for facilitating game-based learning in cyber security. It will describe CyberCraft, the collection of Minecraft: EE offerings curated and/or developed by the University of Exeter, introduce facilitators and educators to the learning resources available to them to build confidence in the tool and lesson planning, and set out the different pedagogic models, lesson types, modalities, tools and techniques for learning supported and enhanced by Minecraft: Education Edition. It will set CyberCraft into the context of "CyberGBL", the name for the package of cyber security education support resources developed by the University of exeter in support of the NCSC CyberWEST project. This activity will conclude by showcasing an example "Build challenge" lesson plan using the "Teach, Build, Release, Reflect model" which can be delivered directly to students, or used to inspire your own; upon completion educators should be confident to start integrating the Minecraft experience into their curriculum or club activity design, and know where to go for more support.
