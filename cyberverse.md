# **CyberTAP: The Battle for the CyberVerse TCG**

# Activity Overview
This activity is designed to teach students about the different elements of a threat model in the form of a Trading Card Game. It will use game components such as cards, card decks, polyhedral dice, playmats, counters and rulebooks to incorporate threat model elements which relate to curricula and are already widely understood and enjoyed by students of all ages, from primary to higer education and beyond.
It will also use commonly understood game mechanics such as deckbuilding, card-action playing, positive and negative effects, levelling and evolution, strategies and playstyles which, again, students who enjoy games from cards to tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) to video games will already be comfortable and confident with and will strongly relate to. It will also be an opportunity for students who are not part of teh gaming community to experiment and learn not only with cyber concepts but gaming also, in a low-cost, low-risk environment.
CyberTAP will have the primary game mode, "The Battle for the CyberVerse" which will conform to the game rules as defined in the core rulebook but it is extensible, using concepts that students are familiar with such as deckbuilding and validation, and custom card creation to further extend the teaching and learning opportunities which can be derived from the game.
