# **CyberPick: Physical security of cyber assets**

# Activity Overview
This activity is designed to support students in learning about the different tools, techniques and procedures which threat actors may deploy in the physical domain either in support of technical or procedural attacks as a joint effect, or when other techniques are not viable. In the cases are packs of training locks, picks, rakes and tension wrenches to allow students to learn the art of lockpicking in order to enhance their ability to understand threats to the information assets for which they may one day be responsible for protecting, to apply patience, precision and discipline, and to enjoy learning a new skill.
